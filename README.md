CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript 2020
This is my journey through the CS50 course on web-programming, I ended up doing more than just the projects. For each lecture I will usually have the lecture codes that I coded alongside the lectures themselves and the projects are found in a separate folder like wiki, search, commerce etc.
